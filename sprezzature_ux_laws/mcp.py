sprezzature-ux-laws — Model Context Protocol (MCP) surface.

Adapter that republishes the FastAPI app in :mod:`sprezzature_ux_laws.api`
as MCP tools, so any MCP-aware host — an agent runtime, an IDE integration,
a custom shell — can call ``check_contrast`` / ``simulate_color_blindness``
/ ``get_palette`` as first-class tools instead of guessing at a shell
command. Uses :mod:`fastapi_mcp` (https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp):
one wrapper over the whole existing HTTP surface, so the routes serve both
plain HTTP callers and MCP hosts without being written twice.

Why a wrapper rather than a hand-written server
-----------------------------------------------
A hand-written MCP server would be a second description of the same
surface, free to drift from the routes it claims to mirror — a tool whose
argument names quietly disagree with the API is worse than no tool, because
the disagreement only shows up at call time. Deriving the tools from the
FastAPI signatures means the two cannot disagree: the ``operation_id`` on
each route *is* the tool name, and the Pydantic model *is* the schema.

Why colour checks are worth giving an agent
--------------------------------------------
These are questions with defensible answers rather than opinions. A contrast
ratio is defined by WCAG; a colour-vision simulation is a published matrix.
An assistant asked "is this palette accessible?" can now answer with a
number it computed instead of an impression it formed — and be wrong in a
way that is checkable.

Install the extra to pull in ``fastapi-mcp``::

    pip install 'sprezzature-ux-laws[api,mcp]'

Then run the MCP server::

    sprezzature-ux-laws-mcp          # entry point (see pyproject)
    # or, equivalently:
    python -m sprezzature_ux_laws.mcp

Usage Example
-------------
>>> # Register the MCP endpoint in your client. It publishes:
>>> #   health / list_laws / audit_interface
>>> # ...with the same argument names as the FastAPI routes.
