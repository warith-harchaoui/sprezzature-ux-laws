"""
The version is written in two places and read in a third, and nothing tied
them together.

``__version__`` is what ``api.py`` hands FastAPI, so it reaches
``/openapi.json`` and the headline an MCP host displays; ``pyproject.toml`` is
what pip installs. In ``sprezzature-figures`` those two drifted and the API
advertised 2.0.0 through the whole 2.1.0 release — a defect no test could see,
because neither number is used by any code path a test exercises.

The CHANGELOG is the third: a release whose top section names an older version
ships undocumented changes.

Read with a regex rather than ``tomllib``, which is stdlib only from 3.11 while
this package supports 3.10.
